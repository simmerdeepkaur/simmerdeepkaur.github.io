            <p>My odyssey into the world of journalism started as an undergraduate, and it has been a rather invigorating one. After working as a part of my university's editorial team, serving as the General Secretary of a Rotaract club and interning with several media outlets in North India, I am now pursuing my Master of Journalism at the UC Berkeley Graduate School of Journalism. Through it all, I have produced meaningful stories, covering a wide variety of topics such as 'The Greek Revolution', 'COVID-19 Ambush on Mental Health', 'The Health Treasury of a Plant-Based Diet', 'Understanding and Managing OCD', 'The Despicable Reality of Marital Rape in India', and 'The Incorruptible World of Literature,' to name a few. Four years of academic coursework and rigorous fieldwork have made journalism an indispensable part of my life. With it, I wake up every day determined to perform my best, live my best and hope for the best, not getting petrified in the face of adversity.This is my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/simmerdeep-kaur-b5a40a245/">LinkedIn profile</a>.</p>
